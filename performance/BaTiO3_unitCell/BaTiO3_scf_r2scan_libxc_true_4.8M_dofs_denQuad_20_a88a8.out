			Welcome to the Open Source program DFT-FE version	1.1.0-pre		        
This is a C++ code for materials modeling from first principles using Kohn-Sham density functional theory.
This is a real-space code for periodic, semi-periodic and non-periodic pseudopotential
and all-electron calculations, and is based on adaptive finite-element discretization.
